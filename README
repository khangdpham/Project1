Usage:

    python hdr.py <ref_frame> <MTB_level> <radius> <sigma_s> <sigma_r> <contrast> <path_to_data>


ref_frame:
    reference picture for alignment, 0~total number of frame are valid
MTB_level:
    level in MTB algorithm, suggest 3
radius:
    kernel radius in Bilateral Filter, 10 is fine in our project
sigma_s:
    spatial parameter in Bilateral Filter, 15 is fine in our project
sigma_r:
    range parameter in Bilateral Filter, 0.5 is fine in our project
contrast:
    the ratio of the max_intensity to min_intensity in image after contrast reducing, meaningful value are between 50~200
path_to_data:
    the path to image data set


All the input images must has file extension 'jpg', case sensitive. (.JPG is invalid)
Only input imgaes can be inside <path_to_data>, no other files can exist.

Result of two versions of tone mapping algorithm is named 'photo_tone_HDR.jpg', 'bilateral_HDR_<contrast>.jpg'
HDR output image is named 'result_hdr.hdr'
